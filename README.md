OWASP AND WCAG GUIDELINES SCAN:
Justification: Why Build This Tool?
1. No Single Tool Does Both OWASP + WCAG in One Place
Most tools focus only on security (like OWASP ZAP, Semgrep) or only on accessibility (like axe-core, Pa11y).
 ✅ Your tool bridges two crucial quality domains — Security and Accessibility — in a single scan/report.
🔥 "Why should a developer need two tools and two workflows to make their app secure and inclusive?"
2. One-Click Report for Devs, PMs, and QA
Your tool doesn’t just scan — it aggregates, tags, and explains:
Categorizes issues (e.g., “OWASP: Broken Auth” or “WCAG 2.1.1 Keyboard Navigation”)


Gives remediation tips


Optionally outputs a beautiful HTML/Markdown report for stakeholders.


🚀 "We make the results actionable and not just a scary list of warnings."
3. Unlike large-scale tools that need enterprise setup (like SonarQube or Lighthouse CI), your tool:
Runs with one command or button


Works locally or in CI


Supports common stacks like JavaScript/React/Python/Node


🎯 "We focused on developer ease-of-use — you don’t need a DevOps team to run this."
